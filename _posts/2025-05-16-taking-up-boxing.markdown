Following the success of Zepp and my smartwatch, I've decided to take up a new challenge: boxing at Gosforth Gym Group.

The journey with Zepp and my smartwatch has been a real game-changer for my fitness and motivation. Tracking my progress, seeing improvements, and having that extra bit of accountability has made a huge difference. Now, I'm ready to push myself even further.

Boxing is something I've always admired from afar, but never tried. Gosforth Gym Group has a great reputation, and I'm excited (and a bit nervous!) to step into the ring, learn the ropes, and see how far I can go.

Stay tuned for updates on my boxing journey, training sessions, and what it's like to start something completely new as an adult. If you've ever thought about trying boxing or joining a new gym, let me knowâ€”I'd love to hear your experiences!
