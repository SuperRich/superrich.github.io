As a developer who's been working with AI-powered development tools for some time now, I've had the opportunity to extensively test both Cursor and VS Code's new Agent Mode. Here's my honest take on how they stack up against each other.

## My Current Setup

Cursor has been my go-to choice for AI-assisted development, and I have to admit I'm genuinely impressed by what VS Code Agent Mode brings to the table. However, there are some notable differences that affect my daily workflow.

## Performance Comparison

The most significant difference I've noticed is **speed**. VS Code Agent Mode feels considerably slower compared to Cursor, even when using GPT-4.1. This performance gap becomes quite noticeable during longer coding sessions where you're relying heavily on AI assistance.

Cursor's responsiveness has spoiled me somewhat - the near-instantaneous suggestions and completions make for a much smoother development experience. When you're in the flow state, every second of delay matters.

## Model Preferences

My model of choice has been **Claude Sonnet 3.7** - that was until a few days ago when Opus and Sonnet 4 were announced. The landscape is evolving rapidly, and it's exciting to see these improvements in AI capabilities.

The ability to choose different models based on the task at hand is crucial. Sometimes you need the speed of a lighter model for simple completions, other times you want the reasoning power of the latest and greatest for complex architectural decisions.

## The Reality of Corporate Constraints

Here's the thing though - choice isn't always in our hands. At work, we're restricted to using VS Code Agent Mode, which means I don't have the luxury of choosing my preferred tool during office hours. This corporate reality is something many developers face.

It's a reminder that whilst we might have preferences for our personal projects, enterprise environments often dictate the tools we use. The key is becoming proficient with multiple options.

## Looking Forward

I think if VS Code Agent Mode can catch up to Cursor in terms of speed and responsiveness, I'd be more inclined to consider making the switch. Microsoft has the resources and ecosystem to potentially create something truly compelling.

The integration with the broader VS Code ecosystem is already impressive, and if they can solve the performance issues, it could become a serious contender for developers who prefer staying within the Microsoft toolchain.

## Final Thoughts

Both tools represent the exciting future of AI-assisted development. Cursor currently wins on speed and user experience, whilst VS Code Agent Mode offers deeper integration with an established ecosystem.

The real winner here is us developers - having multiple high-quality options pushes each tool to improve and innovate. Whether you're team Cursor or team VS Code, we're all benefiting from this healthy competition.

What's your experience been with these AI development tools? I'd love to hear your thoughts on which direction the industry is heading.
