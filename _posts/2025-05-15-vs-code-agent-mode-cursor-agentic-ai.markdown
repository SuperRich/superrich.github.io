## The Rise of Agentic AI in Developer Tools

If you've been following the latest in dev tooling, you'll know there's been a proper revolution in how we interface with our code editors. Two major players in this space—VS Code's Agent Mode and Cursor's Agentic AI—have changed the game for us developers.

## VS Code Agent Mode

Microsoft recently introduced Agent Mode to VS Code, bringing AI assistance directly into the editor we all know and love. Some key features include:

- Inline code suggestions and completions
- Natural language explanations of complex code
- Automated refactoring suggestions
- Context-aware documentation lookup

What makes VS Code's implementation interesting is how they've integrated it into the existing extension ecosystem. It's a natural evolution rather than a complete paradigm shift.

## Cursor's Agentic AI Approach

Cursor, on the other hand, took a more radical approach by building their editor from the ground up with AI at its core. As a fork of VS Code, Cursor maintains familiarity while pushing the boundaries of what's possible:

- Full-context code understanding
- Autonomous coding sessions where the AI can take multiple steps to solve complex problems
- Ability to read, navigate, and modify large codebases with natural language
- More sophisticated reasoning about code structures and patterns

The way Cursor handles context is particularly impressive. It can maintain awareness of your entire project, not just the file you're working on.

## My Experience: The Good and the Bad

Using both tools for the past few months, I've noticed some distinct differences:

**VS Code Agent Mode**:
- More stable and predictable
- Better integration with existing workflows
- Less resource-intensive
- Sometimes less intuitive for complex tasks

**Cursor**:
- More powerful for complex refactoring
- Better understanding of project architecture
- Occasionally unpredictable or "too creative"
- Higher resource requirements

## Which One Should You Choose?

If you're deeply embedded in the VS Code ecosystem and value stability, Agent Mode is a solid choice. It enhances rather than replaces your workflow.

If you're willing to embrace a new paradigm and want the most powerful AI assistance available, Cursor might be the better option. Its ability to reason about code at a higher level can save significant time on complex tasks.

For me, as a .NET developer working on both legacy systems and new projects, I've found myself switching between both tools depending on the task at hand. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here.

## The Future of Coding

What excites me most isn't just what these tools can do now, but where they're headed. We're only at the beginning of the agentic AI revolution in development. Soon enough, we'll likely look back at manual coding the way we now view assembly language—a respectable skill, but not how most of us spend our day-to-day.

What do you think? Have you tried either tool? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments.
