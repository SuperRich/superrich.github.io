## Hello, I'm Richard!

Born and raised in Newcastle upon Tyne, I'm still proudly living in the Toon. I'm also a dedicated dad to a football-mad young lad, just like his old man. And aye, I'm one of those proper Newcastle fans from way before the Saudis took over—I've stuck with the team through thick and thin, including two relegations!

My passion for tech sparked at the age of 10 when I stumbled upon a C++ book in Waterstones. Since those early days playing with Windows 95, I've been fascinated by technology and computing. My educational journey wasn't straightforward; after a brief detour in sixth form studying film and drama perhaps with big grand delusions of being an actor, I pivoted to a computing foundation degree at Newcastle College, eventually earning a degree in Computer Systems Engineering from the University of Sunderland. Let me tell you, as a proud Geordie, studying in Sunderland back when their football team was half-decent was definitely a challenge! Thankfully it was just computer nerds and they don't really know football. Is that a self-burn? maybe...

Today, I'm deeply immersed in Generative AI and excited about where this technology is headed. Even my son, who's not yet eight, knows about ChatGPT! The potential of AI and agents is extraordinary—it amplifies human capability exponentially and makes intelligence accessible to everyone. As thrilling as it is, I do sometimes wonder: how advanced will it get, and what does it mean for my son's future, as well as my own?

I'm always keen to connect and discuss the latest in Gen AI, tech trends, or even reminisce about Newcastle's ups and downs—feel free to reach out at richyhunter.rh@gmail.com. If you want coaching, please see the coaching section.
